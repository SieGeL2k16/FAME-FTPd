                    How to upload files using FAME-FTPd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the FAME-FTPd daemon displays only a virtual filesystem, you have to 
upload your files directly into the conference where the files belong to.
Please note that you are not allowed to create any directories, and your
filenames must match the same rules the traditional upload via FAME defines,
else your files have to be renamed later!

After uploading your files you will see them appearing in the conference
directories only as long as you leave your connection active, but this of
course does not mean that your files get removed, only the server simply
"forgets" all files from you after you logout.

To finalize the upload(s) and get credits you MUST (!) connect directly
to FAME and you will be prompted with a list of all uploaded files. Sorry
for this, but no other possibility exists to bring in files from outside
of FAME.
